    <h1>Common Git Errors and Their Causes</h1>
    <h2>1. Another git process seems to be running</h2>
    <p>
        This error occurs when a Git process is interrupted or crashes, leaving a lock file (<code>.git/index.lock</code>) behind. This lock file prevents other Git operations from running to avoid conflicts. Removing the lock file manually resolves this issue.
    </p>
    
    <h2>2. fatal: 'origin' does not appear to be a git repository</h2>
    <p>
        This error occurs when the remote repository URL is not set or is incorrect. You need to add the correct remote repository URL using <code>git remote add origin &lt;repository-url&gt;</code>.
    </p>
    
    <h2>3. Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind its remote counterpart</h2>
    <p>
        This error occurs when your local branch is behind the remote branch. It means there are new commits in the remote repository that your local repository doesn't have. To resolve this, you need to pull the latest changes from the remote repository using <code>git pull origin master</code> before pushing your changes.
    </p>
    
    <h2>4. You have not concluded your merge (MERGE_HEAD exists)</h2>
    <p>
        This error occurs when you have an unfinished merge. Git creates a <code>MERGE_HEAD</code> file during a merge to keep track of the merge state. You need to complete the merge by committing the changes before you can perform other Git operations.
